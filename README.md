# Titanic Survival Analysis & Modeling

This project explores the Titanic dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling using logistic regression. It is organized into two Jupyter notebooks:

- ðŸ“Š **TitanicDataEDA.ipynb** â€“ Performs detailed EDA on the full, train, and test datasets, including distribution plots, correlation matrices, and scatter plots.
- ðŸ¤– **TitanicModelLogisticRegression.ipynb** â€“ Preprocesses the dataset, builds a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance using classification metrics and a confusion matrix.

## ðŸ“¦ Required Packages

To run the notebooks smoothly, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
